# Introduction
The provided Python code simulates heat transfer in a solid using the Euler method. The heat transfer equation considers the thermal conductivity of the solid, surface area, thickness, and initial and external temperatures.

# Requirements
To run the code, you need:

Python (version 3.x)
Matplotlib (for plotting)
